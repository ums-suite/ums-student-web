/**
 * A short-poll utility (SWEB-8, requirement-spec.md §2 Real-time/live-data row: "Short-poll
 * (5–15s) for seat-availability during registration windows and for fee/payment status after a
 * gateway redirect").
 *
 * Deliberately just `timer` + `switchMap` -- a lightweight poll loop is simpler and cheaper to get
 * right than a push channel scoped to one burst window (§2's own stated reasoning, reaffirmed by
 * design-decisions.md "Seat-Gauge Trust Boundary"). `switchMap` (not `concatMap`/`mergeMap`) means
 * a slow-to-respond poll tick is abandoned rather than queued the instant the next interval fires,
 * so the poll never falls progressively behind real time under load.
 *
 * Fires immediately (`timer(0, ...)`) so the very first render doesn't wait a full interval for
 * its first value, then repeats every `intervalMs`. The caller controls the poll's lifetime by
 * unsubscribing (e.g. via Angular's `takeUntilDestroyed()`) -- this utility has no concept of
 * "stop after N ticks" by itself.
 *
 * Reused as-is by SWEB-11 (seat-availability + `RegistrationWindow` status, folded into one poll
 * payload per design-decisions.md) and, later, SWEB-22's post-gateway-redirect payment-status poll
 * -- one mechanism, two call sites, per this app's own cross-cutting-infrastructure plan.
