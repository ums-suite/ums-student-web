/**
 * Base for a **provisional** module data-access client (SWEB-5).
 *
 * `@ums/shared`'s committed OpenAPI contract (`contracts/ums-core.v1.json`) currently covers only
 * Identity, Audit, and Organization (~41 operations) -- `Academic`, `Student`, `Finance`,
 * `Hostel`, and `Library` (requirement-spec.md §6, this app's actual primary modules) have not
 * yet shipped a generated TypeScript client, even though all five are real and implemented
 * server-side in `ums-core` (verified directly against its `src/UMS.Modules/*` source, not
 * guessed). Every data-access service for those five modules extends this class instead of
 * hand-rolling its own `HttpClient` plumbing, so:
 *
 * - they share the exact same base URL as the generated client and `UMS_AUTH_CONFIG`
 *   ({@link APP_CONFIG}, wired in `provide-core-http.ts`);
 * - they automatically pick up the same interceptor chain (correlation id, locale, bearer/refresh)
 *   since they go through the same injected `HttpClient`;
 * - every failure is normalized through `toUmsApiError`, matching what a generated service's
 *   consumers already get, so a feature never has to special-case "provisional module" error
 *   handling versus "generated module" error handling;
 * - replacing one with `@ums/shared`'s real generated equivalent later is a mechanical swap of the
 *   class a feature module injects, not a rewrite of how it calls or handles errors.
 *
 * Each subclass's own doc comment names the concrete endpoint paths it assumes, verified against
 * `ums-core/src/UMS.Modules/<Module>/UMS.Modules.<Module>.Api/Endpoints/*.cs` directly, and flags
 * any confirmed gap (a route the frontend needs but the backend doesn't have yet) rather than
 * guessing. **Never rely on one of these for anything security-sensitive beyond what the server
 * itself enforces** -- exactly like a generated client, this is a thin HTTP wrapper, not a trust
 * boundary.
