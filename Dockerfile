# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
#
# Builds ums-student-web's CSR-only bundle. Two-stage build, mirroring ums-core's own Dockerfile
# rationale: the `build` stage needs the full Node/npm toolchain plus devDependencies (the
# Angular CLI/compiler) to run `ng build`; the `runtime` stage copies only the compiled
# `dist/student-web/browser` static output into a slim nginx image, so the final image ships
# neither devDependencies/Node nor the Angular build tooling. Unlike the three SSR apps
# (ums-admission-web/ums-public-web/ums-alumni-web), this app has no `@angular/ssr`/Express server
# to run - it is a pure client-side-routed SPA (no `serve:ssr:*` script in package.json) - so
# nginx serving static files plus a client-side-routing fallback (nginx.conf) is the entire
# runtime, no Node needed at all.
#
# API_BASE_URL (build arg): Angular inlines `environment.ts` into the compiled bundle at build
# time - it is not a runtime-configurable value - so this app's API base URL has to be baked in
# here rather than passed as a container env var. Defaults to the browser-reachable
# host-published ums-core port (matches ums-devops's own UMS_CORE_PORT default): since this app
# is CSR-only, every API call originates in the browser, so this is a full, unqualified fix (no
# server-side-fetch caveat like the three SSR apps have).

# nginx:alpine's master process must stay root to bind port 80 and manage its worker processes,
# but the workers that actually serve requests already drop to the image's own unprivileged
# "nginx" user by default - no extra USER directive needed here (unlike the Node-based images in
# this platform's other Dockerfiles, which do need one).
